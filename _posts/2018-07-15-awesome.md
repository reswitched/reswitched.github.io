title: Awesome Switch
---

The switch hacking scene has sprouted a lot of useful tools and documentation,
but those can be fairly hard to find due to being posted left and right without
a central repository to list it all. But no more! This awesome list will attempt
to be a complete list of all the useful things that the switch hacking community
created.

If you see something missing, feel free to leave a comment [here](https://github.com/ReswitchedWeekly/ReswitchedWeekly.github.io/issues/41)
so I can add it in.
